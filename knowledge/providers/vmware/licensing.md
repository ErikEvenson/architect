# VMware / Broadcom Licensing (Post-2024)

## Scope

This file covers **VMware licensing under Broadcom ownership**: edition selection (VCF vs VVF), per-core pricing mechanics, subscription-only model, bundle consolidation, Broadcom acquisition impact, price increase patterns, partner ecosystem changes, license audit risks during migration, support policy changes, and TCO comparison methodology for evaluating alternatives. For hypervisor migration execution, see `patterns/hypervisor-migration.md`. For Nutanix migration tooling, see `providers/nutanix/migration-tools.md`. For general workload migration, see `general/workload-migration.md`.

## Checklist

- [ ] **[Critical]** Has the licensing model been confirmed as VCF (full stack) or VVF (vSphere only), and does the selected edition include all required components — particularly vSAN, NSX, and Aria — or will third-party alternatives be needed to fill gaps?
- [ ] **[Critical]** Is per-core licensing impact calculated for all target server hardware, using the formula: (number of CPUs × cores per CPU × per-core price), with the 16-core minimum per CPU applied even if the physical CPU has fewer cores?
- [ ] **[Critical]** Has the transition plan from perpetual licenses (if applicable) been documented, including support renewal deadlines, subscription start dates, and budget impact of moving from CapEx (perpetual) to OpEx (subscription)?
- [ ] **[Critical]** Has a Broadcom-authorized partner been identified for quoting, since VMware licensing is no longer available through all resellers and pricing is not publicly listed?
- [ ] **[Critical]** Are CPU core counts factored into hardware selection decisions — evaluating whether fewer high-core-count servers (higher license cost, fewer servers to manage) or more lower-core-count servers (lower license cost, more physical infrastructure) optimizes total cost of ownership?
- [ ] **[Critical]** Has the 72-core minimum per CPU (effective April 2025) been factored into licensing calculations, since servers with fewer than 72 physical cores per CPU still incur licensing for 72 cores?
- [ ] **[Critical]** Has the VMware renewal date been identified and used as a migration planning milestone, since late renewals incur a 20% penalty on first-year subscription price?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Has a VCF vs VVF feature comparison been performed against actual requirements, since VCF includes vSAN (eliminating external SAN/NAS licensing), NSX (eliminating physical east-west firewall licensing), and Aria (eliminating third-party monitoring/automation licensing)?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Is the total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis comparing VMware subscription against alternatives (Nutanix, Proxmox, OpenStack, Azure Stack HCI) documented as an ADR, including migration costs, retraining, and ecosystem tool compatibility?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Are support tier requirements defined — Production support (24/7, 4-hour response for Sev 1) vs Basic support (12×5, next business day) — and is the cost delta justified by workload criticality?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Is license compliance monitoring in place to detect core count changes when hosts are added, CPUs are upgraded, or VMs are migrated to hosts with different core counts?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Are VCF-included components (vSAN, NSX, Aria, Tanzu, HCX) being actively used, since the licensing cost includes them regardless — unused included components represent unrealized value?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Has a dual-platform license audit risk assessment been performed for migration periods where both VMware and the target platform are running simultaneously?
- [ ] **[Recommended]** Has the vSphere end-of-support timeline been mapped against migration plans, since vSphere 7.x reached end of general support on October 2, 2025 and vSphere 8.x is scheduled for October 2027?
- [ ] **[Optional]** Has Broadcom's partner program change impact been assessed — specifically whether your existing VMware partner is still authorized and whether alternative partners offer better pricing or support?
- [ ] **[Optional]** Is a license optimization review scheduled annually to right-size core counts, retire unused hosts, and evaluate whether workload consolidation can reduce the licensed core footprint?
- [ ] **[Optional]** Has VMware Explore (formerly VMworld) or Broadcom partner briefing intelligence been gathered on upcoming licensing changes, since Broadcom has made multiple adjustments since the initial 2024 restructure?

## Why This Matters

Broadcom's 2024 acquisition of VMware fundamentally changed the licensing model from per-socket perpetual licenses to per-core subscriptions, and consolidated dozens of individual products into two primary bundles: VCF and VVF. This has significant financial and architectural implications. An organization running 4 dual-socket servers with 32-core CPUs (256 total cores) under the old model paid for 8 socket licenses regardless of core count. Under the new model, they pay for 256 cores annually. For high-core-count CPUs (64+ cores per socket), the licensing cost increase can be 3-5x compared to the old per-socket model. This directly impacts hardware selection: a server with two 64-core AMD EPYC CPUs (128 cores) costs significantly more in VMware licensing than two 32-core CPUs (64 cores), even though the hardware price difference may be modest. The elimination of perpetual licenses means organizations can no longer capitalize VMware as a one-time purchase — it becomes a recurring operational expense that must be budgeted annually. VCF bundles vSAN, NSX, Aria, Tanzu, and HCX into a single subscription, which can be cost-effective if all components are used but represents overspend if the organization only needs basic vSphere compute. VVF provides a lower-cost option for organizations that use external storage (SAN/NAS) and do not need NSX or Aria, but it lacks the validated-design lifecycle management that SDDC Manager provides. Broadcom also reduced the number of authorized partners, so organizations may need to find new procurement channels. Pricing is not publicly available and varies significantly by partner, volume, and negotiation — budget planning requires actual quotes rather than list price calculations.

## Common Decisions (ADR Triggers)

- **VCF vs VVF** — VCF for environments needing vSAN (hyper-converged, no external SAN), NSX (microsegmentation, load balancing), and Aria (monitoring, automation) vs VVF for environments with existing SAN/NAS investment, physical firewalls, and third-party monitoring that only need vSphere compute and vCenter management
- **VMware vs alternative hypervisors** — VMware for ecosystem maturity, enterprise support, existing team skills, and application vendor support certifications vs Nutanix (comparable HCI with different licensing), Proxmox (open-source, dramatically lower cost, limited enterprise support), OpenStack (open-source, significant operational overhead), or Azure Stack HCI (Microsoft ecosystem integration); migration costs and retraining often exceed 2-3 years of licensing savings
- **High-core vs low-core CPU selection** — fewer servers with high-core CPUs for maximum consolidation ratio and reduced physical infrastructure vs more servers with lower-core CPUs to minimize per-core licensing cost; the breakeven depends on per-core license price, server hardware cost, rack space cost, power/cooling cost, and management overhead per server
- **Production vs Basic support** — Production support (24/7, 4-hour Sev 1 response) for business-critical workloads where downtime has significant financial impact vs Basic support (12×5, next business day) for development, test, or non-critical workloads; many organizations mix tiers across environments
- **Annual vs multi-year subscription** — annual subscription for flexibility to change platforms or reduce footprint vs multi-year commitment (typically 3 years) for discounted per-core pricing; multi-year locks in spend but may include price protection against future increases
- **Use VCF-included components vs existing third-party tools** — adopt vSAN/NSX/Aria since they are included in VCF licensing (reduces third-party tool spend, simplifies stack) vs retain existing SAN/firewall/monitoring investments to avoid migration risk, retraining, and operational disruption; often a phased transition over 2-3 renewal cycles
- **Stay on VMware vs migrate to alternative platform** — stay on VMware to avoid migration risk and retain existing operational expertise vs migrate to reduce licensing costs, with the decision driven by renewal timeline pressure, price increase magnitude, and team readiness to operate a new platform

### Per-Core Licensing Cost Impact — Hardware Selection

```
Scenario A: High-Core Consolidation
  2 servers × 2 CPUs × 64 cores = 256 licensed cores
  Hardware: ~$30K × 2 = $60K
  VMware:   256 cores × $price/core/year
  Servers to manage: 2
  Rack units: 2-4U

Scenario B: Lower-Core, More Servers
  4 servers × 2 CPUs × 32 cores = 256 licensed cores  (same!)
  Hardware: ~$20K × 4 = $80K
  VMware:   256 cores × $price/core/year  (same license cost)
  Servers to manage: 4
  Rack units: 4-8U

Scenario C: Optimized Core Count
  3 servers × 2 CPUs × 24 cores = 144 licensed cores
  Hardware: ~$22K × 3 = $66K
  VMware:   144 cores × $price/core/year  (44% less than A/B)
  Servers to manage: 3
  Rack units: 3-6U
  Trade-off: fewer total cores = lower VM density

Key Insight: Total core count drives license cost, not server count.
             Right-size CPU core count to actual workload needs.
             16-core minimum per CPU means a 12-core CPU still pays
             for 16 cores.

## Broadcom Acquisition Impact

### Acquisition Timeline and Licensing Overhaul

Broadcom completed its acquisition of VMware in November 2023. Beginning in early 2024, Broadcom executed a series of changes that fundamentally restructured VMware's licensing, pricing, partner ecosystem, and support model. These changes have been the most disruptive event in the virtualization market in over a decade.

**Key milestones:**

- **November 2023** — Broadcom closes VMware acquisition for $61 billion
- **December 2023** — Broadcom notifies all VMware partners that existing partner programs and incentives will cease effective February 4, 2024
- **February 2024** — Perpetual license sales end; subscription-only model takes effect; partner program reset begins
- **April 2024** — Product SKU consolidation from ~8,000 SKUs to approximately 4 bundled offerings
- **July 2024** — vSphere 7.x end-of-general-support extended by 6 months (from April 2025 to October 2025)
- **April 2025** — Minimum core requirement per CPU increases from 16 to 72 cores
- **October 2025** — vSphere 7.x and vSAN 7.x reach end of general support

### Transition from Perpetual to Subscription-Only Licensing

Broadcom eliminated perpetual license sales entirely in early 2024. Under the previous VMware model, organizations purchased a perpetual license (one-time CapEx) and renewed annual support contracts (typically 20-25% of license cost per year). Under the new model, all VMware software is subscription-only (OpEx), with terms of 1, 3, or 5 years.

**Impact on existing perpetual license holders:**

- Existing perpetual licenses remain legally valid and can continue to be used
- Support contracts for perpetual licenses will not be renewed once the current contract expires
- Without active support, no security patches, bug fixes, or technical support are available
- Perpetual license holders with expired support contracts have received cease-and-desist letters warning them to stop using updates or patches issued after support expiration
- Organizations must choose between transitioning to a subscription or running unsupported software

**Financial model shift:**

```
Previous Model (Perpetual):
  Year 1: License purchase (CapEx)     $100,000
  Year 2: Support renewal (20%)         $20,000
  Year 3: Support renewal (20%)         $20,000
  Year 4: Support renewal (20%)         $20,000
  Year 5: Support renewal (20%)         $20,000
  5-year total:                         $180,000

New Model (Subscription):
  Year 1: Subscription (OpEx)           $50,000–$150,000/year (varies widely)
  Year 2: Subscription                  $50,000–$150,000/year
  Year 3: Subscription                  $50,000–$150,000/year
  Year 4: Subscription                  $50,000–$150,000/year
  Year 5: Subscription                  $50,000–$150,000/year
  5-year total:                         $250,000–$750,000

Note: Actual subscription pricing varies significantly by core count,
      edition (VCF vs VVF), partner, volume, and negotiation.
      These ranges are illustrative only.
```

### Bundle Consolidation

Broadcom eliminated approximately 8,000 individual product SKUs and consolidated VMware's portfolio into four primary offerings:

| Offering | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) | Full stack: vSphere, vSAN, NSX, SDDC Manager, Aria, Tanzu, HCX | Organizations needing HCI and software-defined networking |
| VMware vSphere Foundation (VVF) | vSphere + vCenter + vSphere Lifecycle Manager | Organizations with existing SAN/NAS and physical networking |
| VMware vSphere Standard (VVS) | Basic vSphere compute | Smaller environments with simpler requirements |
| VMware vSphere Essentials Plus (VVEP) | Entry-level vSphere for small environments | Small deployments (limited host count) |

**Forced bundling impact:**

- Organizations that previously purchased only vSphere and vCenter are now forced into bundles that include components they may not need (vSAN, NSX, Aria)
- VCF is the only option for organizations requiring vSAN — there is no standalone vSAN purchase
- Organizations using third-party storage (NetApp, Pure Storage, Dell PowerStore) and third-party networking (Cisco ACI, Arista) pay for vSAN and NSX capabilities they do not use
- The bundled approach can be cost-effective when all components are actively used, but represents overspend when only vSphere compute is needed

### Price Increase Patterns

Customer-reported price increases since the Broadcom acquisition have been substantial and widely documented:

- **Typical range:** 2x to 10x compared to pre-acquisition costs
- **Extreme cases:** 8x to 15x increases reported, particularly for smaller organizations
- **SMB impact:** Small and mid-size businesses with low core counts are disproportionately affected by minimum core requirements (72-core minimum effective April 2025)
- **Per-core vs per-socket:** The shift from per-socket to per-core pricing particularly impacts organizations with high-core-count CPUs (64+ cores per socket)

**Price increase drivers:**

1. **Subscription vs perpetual** — recurring annual cost replaces one-time purchase plus modest support renewal
2. **Per-core vs per-socket** — high-core-count servers cost dramatically more under per-core pricing
3. **Bundle consolidation** — paying for components (vSAN, NSX, Aria) that were not previously licensed
4. **Minimum core requirements** — 72-core minimum per CPU (April 2025) means small deployments pay for cores they do not have
5. **Late renewal penalty** — 20% surcharge on first-year subscription price if renewal deadline is missed
6. **Reduced competition among partners** — fewer authorized resellers means less pricing pressure

```
72-Core Minimum Impact Example (April 2025+):

  Server with 2 CPUs × 16 cores each = 32 physical cores
  Licensed cores under old model:      32 cores (or 2 sockets)
  Licensed cores under 72-core min:    144 cores (72 per CPU × 2 CPUs)
  Overpayment:                         112 cores (350% more than physical)

  Server with 2 CPUs × 64 cores each = 128 physical cores
  Licensed cores under 72-core min:    128 cores (physical exceeds minimum)
  Overpayment:                         0 cores (minimum does not apply)

Key Insight: The 72-core minimum disproportionately impacts smaller
             servers and SMBs. Organizations with high-core-count CPUs
             are less affected since physical cores exceed the minimum.
```

### Partner and Channel Program Changes

Broadcom has dramatically restructured VMware's partner ecosystem:

**Timeline of partner changes:**

- **December 2023** — All VMware partners notified that existing partner programs will cease
- **February 2024** — VMware partner programs and incentives formally end; over 18,000 resale partners moved to Broadcom's Advantage Partner Program
- **2024** — Bottom tier of VMware partners eliminated; eligibility bar raised across remaining levels; partners below $500K-$1M in revenue may not receive invitations
- **April 2025** — Authorized VMware Cloud Service Providers (VCSPs) reduced from 4,500+ globally to approximately 12 Pinnacle partners and 300+ Premier partners in the US
- **July 2025** — VCSPs notified of new invitation-only Cloud Service Provider program effective November 1, 2025
- **November 2025** — New VCSP program takes effect; non-invited partners restricted to servicing existing contracts only, with no renewals or new contracts

**Impact on customers:**

- Existing VMware partner/reseller may no longer be authorized to sell or support VMware
- Fewer authorized partners means less competitive pricing and fewer options for support
- Organizations must verify their procurement partner's current authorization status
- Pricing is not publicly listed — requires quotes from authorized partners, making budget planning difficult
- Multi-vendor quote comparison is critical but harder with fewer partners available

### Support Policy Changes Under Broadcom

Broadcom restructured VMware's support model alongside the licensing changes:

**Support model changes:**

- All VMware subscriptions include Broadcom Software Maintenance, which provides 24x7 support and access to updates and patches
- The previous distinction between Production (24/7, 4-hour Sev 1) and Basic (12x5, next business day) support tiers has been simplified under Broadcom Software Maintenance
- Partner-provided technical support has been clarified, with some partners authorized to provide first-line support
- Perpetual license holders with expired support contracts receive no patches, updates, or technical support and cannot renew

**Support quality concerns reported by customers:**

- Transition period disruptions as Broadcom integrated VMware support into its existing support infrastructure
- Knowledge base and documentation consolidation from VMware's sites to Broadcom's portal
- Changes to support portal access and account management

### End-of-General-Support Timelines

Understanding end-of-support dates is critical for migration planning:

| Product | End of General Support | Status |
|---|---|---|
| vSphere 6.5 / 6.7 | October 15, 2022 | Ended — no patches or support |
| vSphere 7.0 | October 2, 2025 | Extended from original April 2, 2025 date |
| vSAN 7.x | October 2, 2025 | Extended alongside vSphere 7.x |
| vCenter 7.x | October 2, 2025 | Extended alongside vSphere 7.x |
| vSphere 8.0 | October 11, 2027 | Currently in general support |

**Implications:**

- Organizations on vSphere 7.x that have not upgraded or migrated by October 2025 are running unsupported software with no security patches
- Upgrading to vSphere 8.x requires transitioning to subscription licensing — there is no perpetual license path to vSphere 8
- The vSphere 8.x end-of-support date (October 2027) creates a hard deadline for organizations considering longer migration timelines
- Running unsupported vSphere versions may violate compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2) that mandate vendor-supported software

### Timeline Pressure from Renewal Dates

VMware subscription renewal dates create hard decision points that drive migration timelines:

**Renewal date as migration trigger:**

- Organizations approaching renewal face the full impact of new pricing — this is often the moment when alternative platform evaluation begins
- Multi-year commitments (3 or 5 years) lock in spend and delay the ability to migrate, but may offer price protection
- Late renewal incurs a 20% penalty, creating urgency to decide before the renewal deadline
- Organizations mid-contract have a window to plan and execute migration before the next renewal
- The combination of price increases and renewal deadlines is the single largest driver of VMware-to-alternative migrations

**Migration timeline planning against renewal:**

```
Typical Migration Timeline:

  Renewal date minus 18 months:  Begin alternative platform evaluation
  Renewal date minus 12 months:  Complete POC on target platform
  Renewal date minus 9 months:   Begin phased workload migration
  Renewal date minus 3 months:   Complete migration of critical workloads
  Renewal date:                  Do not renew (or renew reduced footprint)
  Renewal date plus 3 months:    Decommission remaining VMware infrastructure

  Warning: Compressed timelines (< 12 months) significantly increase
           migration risk. If the renewal date is imminent, consider
           a 1-year renewal to buy time rather than rushing migration.
```

### License Audit Considerations During Migration

Running dual platforms during migration creates specific license compliance risks:

**Dual-platform audit risks:**

- During migration, both VMware and the target platform are running simultaneously — VMware licensing remains required for all cores running ESXi, regardless of VM count
- Decommissioning hosts without formally releasing licenses can create audit discrepancies
- vMotion or migration of VMs to hosts with different core counts changes the licensed footprint
- Broadcom is expected to increase audit frequency under the subscription model
- Subscription agreements typically include audit rights allowing Broadcom to verify core counts

**Audit preparation during migration:**

1. Maintain a current inventory of all ESXi hosts and their core counts throughout migration
2. Document the decommissioning date of each host as workloads are migrated off
3. Retain copies of subscription agreements, purchase orders, and license certificates
4. Track the licensed core count versus deployed core count weekly during migration
5. Formally notify Broadcom or the authorized partner when hosts are decommissioned to adjust the subscription
6. Do not assume that powering off a host releases the license — licenses are tied to deployed infrastructure, not running state

**Common audit triggers:**

- Adding hosts or upgrading CPUs without adjusting subscription
- Running ESXi on hosts not covered by subscription
- Using features (vSAN, NSX) included in VCF on a VVF subscription
- Continuing to use software after subscription expiration

### Migration Alternatives Triggered by Licensing Changes

The Broadcom licensing changes have driven significant evaluation of alternative platforms. Gartner reported that 74% of IT leaders are exploring VMware alternatives, and Proxmox VE evaluations increased 340% year-over-year.

**Migration considerations by platform:**

- **Nutanix AHV** — Most comparable enterprise alternative; hypervisor included at no extra cost with Nutanix infrastructure; claims up to 42% TCO reduction vs VMware; requires Nutanix hardware or certified hardware; strong migration tooling (Nutanix Move); per-node licensing avoids per-core cost scaling
- **Microsoft Hyper-V / Azure Stack HCI** — Hypervisor bundled with Windows Server licensing (no separate hypervisor cost for Windows shops); Azure Stack HCI adds hybrid cloud management; strong fit for organizations already invested in Microsoft ecosystem; requires Windows Server per-core licensing
- **OpenStack** — Open-source private cloud platform; no software licensing cost but significant operational overhead; requires dedicated engineering team for deployment and operations; best suited for large organizations or service providers with cloud-native operational maturity
- **Proxmox VE** — Open-source KVM-based virtualization with web management; enterprise support from approximately 110 to 1,495 EUR/year per node; documented cases of 94%+ cost reduction vs VMware; growing rapidly (340% increase in evaluations per Gartner); limited enterprise support ecosystem and application vendor certifications
- **KVM (libvirt/virt-manager)** — Bare Linux KVM with no management overlay; zero licensing cost; maximum flexibility but highest operational overhead; suitable for Linux-native workloads and teams with strong Linux administration skills

### Cost Comparison Methodology: VMware Renewal vs Alternative Platform TCO

When evaluating whether to renew VMware or migrate, a rigorous TCO comparison over 3-5 years is essential. The comparison must include all direct and indirect costs, not just software licensing.

**TCO comparison framework:**

```
VMware Renewal TCO (3-5 Year):
├── Software licensing
│   ├── Per-core subscription cost × total cores × years
│   ├── Edition (VCF vs VVF) premium
│   └── Support tier cost
├── Infrastructure
│   ├── Existing hardware (sunk cost — exclude from comparison)
│   ├── Hardware refresh during period (include if planned)
│   └── Storage licensing (if SAN/NAS, not vSAN)
├── Operations
│   ├── VMware administration staff (existing — no change)
│   ├── Training on VCF/VVF changes
│   └── Third-party tools (backup, monitoring, security)
└── Risk
    ├── Future price increases at renewal
    ├── Further bundle consolidation
    └── Partner availability for support

Alternative Platform TCO (3-5 Year):
├── Software licensing
│   ├── Target platform license cost (may be $0 for open source)
│   └── Support subscription (if applicable)
├── Migration costs (one-time)
│   ├── Migration tooling and professional services
│   ├── Testing and validation
│   ├── Dual-platform period (VMware + target running simultaneously)
│   ├── Application recertification
│   └── Downtime cost during migration windows
├── Infrastructure
│   ├── Hardware changes (if target requires different hardware)
│   ├── Network changes (if target uses different networking model)
│   └── Storage changes (if moving from vSAN to alternative)
├── Operations
│   ├── Staff retraining on new platform
│   ├── Hiring or contracting for new platform expertise
│   ├── New third-party tools (backup, monitoring compatibility)
│   ├── Productivity impact during learning curve (6-12 months)
│   └── New operational procedures and automation
└── Risk
    ├── Migration failures and rollback cost
    ├── Application incompatibility discovered post-migration
    ├── Vendor viability (for commercial alternatives)
    └── Reduced application vendor support certification
```

**Common TCO comparison mistakes:**

1. Comparing only software license cost without including migration and retraining expenses
2. Ignoring the dual-platform period cost where both VMware and target platform licenses are required
3. Underestimating the productivity impact of staff learning a new platform
4. Not accounting for application vendor support requirements that may mandate VMware
5. Using VMware's published TCO studies without adjusting for actual environment characteristics
6. Failing to include future VMware price increase risk in the renewal scenario
7. Assuming migration can be completed in the time available before renewal
